# Project Roadmap for Capstone Project

## Proposed Technology Stack and Tools

* Frontend: JavaScript (React), CSS, HTML
* Backend: JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Solidity (Ethereum Smart Contracts)
* Database: MongoDB (aligns with Node.js and provides flexibility for handling
  diverse data types)
* Version Control: Git, GitHub

# Proposed Roadmap

1. Setup Project Environment:
   -[ ] Initialize the project repository.
   -[ ] Set up development and production environments.
   -[ ] Configure version control.

2. Frontend Development:
   -[ ] Create a basic React app structure
   -[ ] Implement wallet connectivity using MetaMask.
   -[ ] Design and develop the user dashboard for tracking reward progress.
   -[ ] Integrate core blockchain functionality (e.g., token minting and
   	burning).

3. Backend Development:
   -[ ] Set up a Node.js server.
   -[ ] Implement business campaign creation and configuration.
   -[ ] Enable payment functionalities via cryptocurrencies (stablecoins).
   -[ ] Integrate NFT generation and claiming.

4. Database Integration:
   -[ ] Connect the backend with MongoDB for data storage.
   -[ ] Implement data models for campaigns, rewards, and user progress.

5. Blockchain Integration:
   -[ ] Develop and deploy smart contracts using Solidity.
   -[ ] Integrate smart contracts with the backend for seamless interaction.
   
6. UI/UX Refinement:
   -[ ] Focus on creating clean and minimalist interfaces.
   -[ ] Ensure intuitive navigation and flow for wallet connectivity.
   -[ ] Implement visual cues for blockchain interactions.
   -[ ] Add notification alerts for key events (e.g., reward claiming).

7. Testing:
   -[ ] Conduct unit testing for individual components.
   -[ ] Perform integration testing for the entire system.
   -[ ] Test wallet connectivity, payment processes, and smart contract
   	interactions.

8. Deployment:
   -[ ] Prepare for deployment to a staging environment.
   -[ ] Conduct thorough testing in the staging environment.
   -[ ] Deploy the MVP to a production environment.

9. Documentation:
   -[ ] Document the MVP architecture and key functionalities.
   -[ ] Provide user guides for wallet connectivity and campaign participation.

10. Review and optimization:
   -[ ] Gather feedback from internal testing.
   -[ ] Optimize code for performance.
   -[ ] Address any identified issues or bugs.
